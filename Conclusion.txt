Conclusions:  

1. In the first script, I successfully sorted three integers using only three simple 'if' statements.   
   
2. In the second script, I created a mixed-type list and counted the string elements using a straightforward iteration method. The use of the type() function helped in identifying the strings.  

3. Both tasks allowed practicing fundamental programming concepts including conditionals and loops, which are essential for solving problems in Python.
